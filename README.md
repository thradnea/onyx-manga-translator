# Onyx Manga Translator

![Onyx Manga Translator Splash](https://i.imgur.com/5MrEkkk.png)

Onyx is a powerful, purely locally running machine translation pipeline designed to translate manga automatically. Integrates an ML model for speech bubble detection (credits below), OCR (credits below), and typesetting to deliver a seamless translation experience right on your own machine.

This tool is designed for readers and scanlation groups who need a fast way to get initial crude, but readable translations of their favorite series.

## Key Features

* **Automated Pipeline**: Handles the entire process from speech bubble detection to final typeset translation.
* **High-Quality OCR**: Utilizes a specialized Manga OCR model to accurately extract Japanese text from complex comic pages.
* **Machine Translation**: Leverages the Google Translate API for fast and effective text translation.
* **Automatic Typesetting**: Cleans the original text from the speech bubbles and typesets the new translated text, fitting it reasonably well to speech bubbles.
* **Fully Local**: The entire pipeline runs on your own resources with no strings attached. No images or data are uploaded to third-party servers, except for the text sent to the Google Translate API.
* **CPU Support**: Runs entirely on your CPU, with plans for CUDA support in the near future on Patreon for faster speeds.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* A Google Cloud account with the Translate API enabled.
* A Google Cloud JSON credentials file.

### Installation & Usage

1. Download the full compressed archive with the PyInstaller executable inside. Extract and run. First boot will ALWAYS take longer, do not be alarmed in that case.
2. Add desired images to the input folder of manga raws in .jpg/.png formats and click "Browse" to locate the input folder.
3. Lastly, add your api.json file from Google Cloud.
